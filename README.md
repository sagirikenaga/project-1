# project-1: What's the Word?

## Description

The purpose of this project is to work as a development team to create a web application that incorporates APIs, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. For this project we attempted to create a spinoff on the popular game named Wordle. Our game differs by having a timer and only four letters per word instead of the typical five letters. This project displays the members ability to work as a team using Agile methodlogy. 

## Usage

This README should be used to guide the user into the motivations for this project which include a gathering effort by the development team to implement what we have learned from the course so far into a web application that will be used by users and generate critical feedback. The following links will show the APIs we used, a screenshot of the sketch we based our project off of, a link to the deployed website, and a picture of the deployed project.
