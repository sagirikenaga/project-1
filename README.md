- SO THAT I can enjoy a game while testing my skills 


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I want to play a word guessing game that uses words from a API

THEN each letter is highlighted as correct, wrong, or misplaced in the guess row
WHEN I look at the on screen keyboard

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a word guessing game that takes a lot of concepts from wordle.

This project will also test the development team's ability to store and retrieve data from the local storage.
